# Python Sorting Algorithms
Testing different sorting algorithms for speed based on a text file containing 1000 random integers ranging from 1 to 1000. To see the times, simply run the main.py

Update 1/16/2020: After taking Data Structures last semester, this repo seems a little redudant since most sorting algorithms are compared by their big O and not their run time, since run time will vary from machine to machine. Either way, I will keep this up as it provides an introspective into how I programmed at the time as well as a handful sorting algorithms implmentated in Python.
